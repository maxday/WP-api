The aim is to share data between two applications using CustomURL

I write two iOS applications :

SenderApp :  

which displays two UITextFields to emulate the content which will be shared

- one for the title of the post 
- the other for the content

and one UIButton to send the content to an FakeWordpressApp

WordpressApp : 

the fake WordpressApp

- display the content pushed by the SenderApp application
